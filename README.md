## Random Data Generators:

Allows you to generate random strings of a given length from letters, numbers, symbols.
Helps to generate passwords, service codes (for example, for sending via SMS), hashes and much more.

## Help:

```python
from smartrandom.random_master import RandomMaster

random_string = RandomMaster.string.get(length=10)
random_number_string = RandomMaster.number.get(length=10)
password = RandomMaster.password.get(length=10)
random_hash = RandomMaster.hash.get(text='give me hash')
random_number_code = RandomMaster.get_code(length=10, number_flag=True)
random_string_code = RandomMaster.get_code(length=10, string_flag=True)
random_symbol_code = RandomMaster.get_code(length=10, symbol_flag=True)

```
